# INTRODUCTION
- The Library Management System is a console-based application created to help organize and manage books in a library or personal collection. It allows users to track the availability of books, borrow or return them, and update the library as needed.

# What It Can Do :
- This application provides several useful features:
  
Add books: Easily add new books to the library with a title and author.
View all books: See a list of all books in the library, along with their status (available or 		borrowed).
Search for a book: Look up a specific book by its unique ID.
Borrow books: Mark books as borrowed when someone takes them.
Return books: Update the status of borrowed books when theyâ€™re returned.
Remove books: Delete books that are no longer needed in the library.

# Why I Made This Application and How does it contribute to me and to the community :
- I created this Library Management System to address the challenges of keeping books organized and accessible, especially for small libraries or personal collections. It contributes to the community by helping small libraries, schools, and individuals efficiently manage their books, promote accountability in borrowing, and encourage the sharing of knowledge and resources.
